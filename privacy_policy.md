# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 20 June 2025_

This privacy policy explains how the **Digital Water Innovations Cluster, KIOS Research & Innovation Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus** (“we”, “us”) use information about you when you:

* use the **Stagona mobile application** (“App”); or
* visit the **Stagona project website** (<https://stagona.cy>) (“Site”).

---

## Types of information we collect and use

### When you use the App

We do **not** collect any personal information. The App runs entirely on your device and never contacts our servers.

### When you visit the Site

We collect basic usage statistics through **Open Web Analytics (OWA)**, which is hosted on University of Cyprus servers in Cyprus. OWA records:

* truncated IP address (last octet removed);
* date and time of each page visit;
* pages viewed;
* browser and operating system;
* device type;
* country or region (city-level); and
* two first-party cookies:
  * `owa_session` – deleted when you close your browser;
  * `owa_persistent` – retained for 12 months to tell us if you are a new or returning visitor.

The Site is served by **GitHub Pages**. GitHub keeps standard web-server logs (full IP address, timestamp, URL, user-agent, referrer) for security and abuse prevention. These logs are held by GitHub as an independent controller under the EU–US Data Privacy Framework and/or Standard Contractual Clauses.

We never combine any of the above with other information to identify you.

---

## Why we use your information

We use analytics information to:

* understand how the Site is used;
* improve its content, design and performance; and
* protect the Site against attacks and abuse.

We do **not** use the data for profiling, marketing or advertising.

---

## How your personal information is stored

* **App:** No information leaves your device.
* **Website analytics:** Stored securely on servers managed by the KIOS CoE, University of Cyprus. Raw data are kept for **up to 14 months**; fully anonymised, aggregated statistics are kept indefinitely.
* **GitHub logs:** Stored by GitHub Inc. in the United States under the safeguards mentioned above.

Access to analytics data is restricted to authorised KIOS personnel and protected by firewalls, encryption at rest and strict access logging.

---

## Your rights

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation you can:

* request a copy of any information we hold about you;
* ask us to correct or update your information;
* restrict how we use your information;
* object to our use of your information;
* have your information transferred to another organisation or to you; and
* ask us to delete your information.

To exercise any of these rights, e‑mail **kios-dwic@ucy.onmicrosoft.com**. We will reply within **30 days**.

## Complaints

If you are unhappy with how we use your personal information you can contact the **Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection** (15 Kypranoros St., 1061 Nicosia, Cyprus; <https://www.dataprotection.gov.cy>).

## Updates to this policy

We may update this privacy policy if we introduce new features that use personal information. Any changes will appear on this page **before** they take effect.
