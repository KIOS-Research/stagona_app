# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: **17 June 2025**_

## 1. Who we are  
**Stagona App** (“the App”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is published by the **Digital Water Innovations Cluster, KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus**, a non-profit research entity established under the laws of Cyprus.  
**Controller e-mail:** kios-dwic@ucy.onmicrosoft.com  
_No Data Protection Officer (DPO) is appointed because no personal data are processed._

## 2. No data collected  
Stagona App runs entirely on your device.

* **No personal data** (name, e-mail, identifiers, IP address, location, cookies, device IDs, etc.) are collected, stored, transmitted, or shared.  
* The App contains **no third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, crash-reporting tools, or social-media plug-ins**.  
* The App **does not** request access to your camera, microphone, photos, contacts, location services, or other system permissions.

Because we process **no personal data**, the lawful bases set out in Articles 6–9 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) do not apply.

## 3. Your rights  
Where no data are processed, most GDPR rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection, restriction) are not triggered.  
If you have questions, contact **kios-dwic@ucy.onmicrosoft.com** and we will respond within **30 days**.

**Right to complain:** You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority or with the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection, Kypranoros 15, Nicosia 1061, Cyprus
s (www.dataprotection.gov.cy).

## 4. Children’s privacy  
The App is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect any information from children under 16—or from anyone else.

## 5. Data security  
Because no data leave your device, there is **no risk of a server-side data breach** originating from us. Platform-level protections still apply.

## 6. Changes to this policy  
If future features require data collection, we will:

1. Update this Privacy Policy in advance;  
2. Obtain explicit consent where required;  
3. Clearly indicate the new practices inside the App.

## 7. Hosting & server logs (website only)  

Our website (<https://kios-research.github.io/stagona_app>) is served by **GitHub Pages**, a service of **GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA**.

When you visit the site, GitHub automatically records **your IP address and basic request metadata** (date/time, user-agent, referrer) in server logs **solely for security and anti-abuse purposes**.  
See:

* [What is GitHub Pages?](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages)  
* [GitHub General Privacy Statement (effective 1 Feb 2024)](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)  
* [GitHub Cookies Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-cookies)

**Cookies:** We set **no cookies**. GitHub sets only essential security cookies on `*.github.io` domains and no marketing cookies.

**Roles & transfers**

* We remain the **data controller** for the website content.  
* GitHub acts as an **independent controller** for its security-log processing and relies on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and/or Standard Contractual Clauses for any cross-border transfers.  
* To exercise GDPR rights regarding these logs, you may contact GitHub directly or write to **kios-dwic@ucy.onmicrosoft.com** and we will forward your request.

No other personal data are collected, and we do not combine GitHub logs with any other information.
